# Techronyms

A quiz-like game for acronyms used within the world of Tech, IT and possibly Gaming.

I scraped a website for acronyms and added them to a sqlite3 database.

run game.py if you want to try the game out, it's super challenging. Just change the file_path variable in game.py so it points to the game directory.

I also created and admin mode (pw: admin) for creating/deleting entries, inspecting the database and run some commands in game.
(reveal answer, enter correct answer, modify difficulty rating).

This was my first project which i made completely myself. Learned a ton about scraping, sqlite3, github and more advanced control flow.

Feedback appreciated!
