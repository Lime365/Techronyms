# Techronyms

A quiz-like game for acronyms used within the world of Tech, IT and possibly Gaming.

run game.py if you want to try the game out, it's super challenging. Just change the "database" variable in game.py so it points to the game directory.

The only 2 files you really need is acronyms.db and game.py. The rest was for scraping and setting up the database schema.

I also created and admin mode (pw: admin) for creating/deleting entries, inspecting the database and run some commands in game.
(reveal answer, enter correct answer, modify difficulty rating). Difficulty-rating has no function in the game at the moment, but the plan is to someday make it scale so it starts easy and gets harder the longer you last.

This was my first project which i made completely myself. Learned a ton about scraping, sqlite3, github and much more.

If you have any feedback, let me know!
